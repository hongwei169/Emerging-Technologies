    "# Title: Collatz Conjecture\n",
    "## Date: 28 September 2023\n",
    "### Author: Hong Wei Phang\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you always get to 1 eventually.\n",
    "![Figure 1](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, starting with the value  10, which is an even number, we divide it by 2 to get 5. We repeat the process, and since 5 is odd, we multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. We divide by 2 successively to get 8, 4, 2 and 1. We needed to multiply by 3 and add 1 only once, but it is possible that f(x) will need to be applied more than once to some numbers, for example f(15) = 46, f(46) = 23.\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "-Using Python to verify, that the Collatz conjecture is true for all integers between 1 and 1000000.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import necessary libraries (if any):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import numpy as np\n",
    "# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n"
