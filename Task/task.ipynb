    "# Title: Collatz Conjecture\n",

    "### Author: Hong Wei Phang\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive integer x and repeatedly apply the function f(x) below, you always get to 1 eventually.\n",
    "![Figure 1](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, starting with the value  10, which is an even number, we divide it by 2 to get 5. We repeat the process, and since 5 is odd, we multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16. We divide by 2 successively to get 8, 4, 2 and 1. We needed to multiply by 3 and add 1 only once, but it is possible that f(x) will need to be applied more than once to some numbers, for example f(15) = 46, f(46) = 23.\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "-Using Python to verify, that the Collatz conjecture is true for all integers between 1 and 1000000.\n",

    "\n",
    "- This function checks the Collatz conjecture for a specified range of numbers, defined by `start` and `end`.\n",
    "- It initializes an empty list to collect cases where the conjecture fails.\n",
    "- It iterates through the range, generates the Collatz sequence for each number, and examines whether the last number in the sequence is not 1. If the last number is not 1, it means the conjecture fails for that number, and it is added to the list of failed cases.\n",
    "- The function returns the list of failed cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `start_number` and `end_number`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These variables specify the range of numbers to be checked for the Collatz conjecture. In the provided code, the range is set to verify the conjecture for numbers between 1 and 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code executes the `verify_collatz_conjecture` function with the defined range.\n",
    "- It checks if there are any failed cases and prints the results accordingly. If there are no failed cases, it indicates that the Collatz conjecture holds true for all numbers in the specified range. If there are failed cases, it lists those numbers for which the conjecture does not hold.\n"

    "The `sqrt` function is used to approximate the square root of a number using Newton's method. It takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `x`: The number for which to find the square root.\n",
    "- `z0`: An initial guess for the square root (default is 1.0).\n",
    "- `tolerance`: The desired level of accuracy (default is 1e-6).\n",

    "The function iteratively applies Newton's method formula to improve the approximation of the square root.\n",
